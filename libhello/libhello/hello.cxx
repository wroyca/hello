// When working with static Thread-Local Storage in MinGW, we may encounter a
// protection fault during relocation. This occurs because MinGW runtime
// includes the tlssup.o object file with the CRT initialization routines,
// which initializes TLS.
//
// More specifically, this happens due to the __dyn_tls_init_callback hook,
// declared in crtdll.c and defined in tlssup.c. Since this hook is non-null by
// default, the linker adds a .tls section to the binary, which assumes a fixed
// base address.
//
// For what itâ€™s worth, other CRTs resolve this by leaving the TLS hook
// uninitialized unless __declspec(thread) variables are used. MinGW, however,
// doesn't handle it this way, so we need to take steps to avoid including
// tlssup.o.
